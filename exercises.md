### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do? (ie. fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)

I write across forms. At the moment I preominantly write long form nonfiction prose poetry (verse memoir), poetry, OP non-fiction, and literary fiction. 

#### What tools (or tecniques) do you use to write?

I use word, a mac, notes, voice memos, diaries/notebooks, google docs/squarespace and grammarly, photos/videos. storyboard. For longform work, and particularly when structuring, I use scrivner. I use pdf reader when editing visual work with inset text. I tend to create multiple files with an initial and number system, and refer to multiple documents at once; this means that there are usually several word documents open at once. I occassionally email notes to myself and sometimes texts. 

I tend to set timers, hour by hour, and give myself short breaks between; if i'm struggling to engage, I tend to write in shorter bursts with longer (5min) breaks. I write more efficiently in the morning before consuming any media so I often try and wake up earlish and start writing before I look at my phone or before talking to anyone. I tend to write sitting on my bed.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Implementing time parameters helps me mitigate issues with focus related to ADHD. Having multiple versions of documents open at once helps me to arrange ideas, implementing multiple structural elements as I go. Scrivner is helpful in arranging or fixing big picture issues. 

## Week 2

### How is elctronic literature different from print literature?

- Electronic literature, as opposed to print literature, often isn't static; it involves some form of interactivity, play 
 
- Electronic literature requires a digital interface. It often uses a z-axis, is multi-dimensional and can be 3D. 

- Electronic literature has a far more diverse set of forms and modalities, utilising existing print literature forms and expanding on them in digital spaces. ELO argue that print work that is digitised is print literature.

- Often Electronic literature relationship to art is more direct, as digital literature converges into digital art. 

- There are often multiple collaborating creators in digital literature

- On a thereotical and response level, there are more ways to read the work e.g. visually, interactivity etc.

- Not restricted by page margins

### what are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

- Electronic literature is 'born of the digital age', utilising digital technologies and (typically) exists online. 

- Can include print literature that had been digitised

- Typically created by a computer and meant to be read on a computer (2007, N. Katherine Hayles)

- Work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer.

- Typically far more accessible as a form

- Often involves non-static elements

- Often blurs the boundaries between 'art' and 'literature'

- There's a technical 'gatekeeper'

- As Electronic Literature is so broad it's difficult to define
