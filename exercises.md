# Exercises

## Week 1

- [x] Create a Github account
- [x] Do the Github 'Hello Word'
- [x] Add a respository for the folio
- [x] What types of writing do you do? (ie. fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)
- [x] What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- [x] How do these tools shape the way you write? (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do? (ie. fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)

I write across forms. At the moment I preominantly write long form nonfiction prose poetry (verse memoir), poetry, OP non-fiction, and literary fiction. 

#### What tools (or tecniques) do you use to write?

I use word, a mac, notes, voice memos, diaries/notebooks, google docs/squarespace and grammarly, photos/videos. storyboard. For longform work, and particularly when structuring, I use scrivner. I use pdf reader when editing visual work with inset text. I tend to create multiple files with an initial and number system, and refer to multiple documents at once; this means that there are usually several word documents open at once. I occassionally email notes to myself and sometimes texts. 

I tend to set timers, hour by hour, and give myself short breaks between; if i'm struggling to engage, I tend to write in shorter bursts with longer (5min) breaks. I write more efficiently in the morning before consuming any media so I often try and wake up earlish and start writing before I look at my phone or before talking to anyone. I tend to write sitting on my bed.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Implementing time parameters helps me mitigate issues with focus related to ADHD. Having multiple versions of documents open at once helps me to arrange ideas, implementing multiple structural elements as I go. Scrivner is helpful in arranging or fixing big picture issues. 

## Week 2

#### How is elctronic literature different from print literature?

- Electronic literature, as opposed to print literature, often isn't static; it involves some form of interactivity, play 
 
- Electronic literature requires a digital interface. It often uses a z-axis, is multi-dimensional and can be 3D. 

- Electronic literature has a far more diverse set of forms and modalities, utilising existing print literature forms and expanding on them in digital spaces. ELO argue that print work that is digitised is print literature.

- Often Electronic literature relationship to art is more direct, as digital literature converges into digital art. 

- There are often multiple collaborating creators in digital literature

- On a thereotical and response level, there are more ways to read the work e.g. visually, interactivity etc.

- Not restricted by page margins

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

- Electronic literature is 'born of the digital age', utilising digital technologies and (typically) exists online. 

- Can include print literature that had been digitised

- Typically created by a computer and meant to be read on a computer (2007, N. Katherine Hayles)

- Work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer.

- Typically far more accessible as a form, but presents a new range of socio-political

- Often involves non-static elements

- Work doesn't necessarily need intent, and can be created without a 'human author'

- Often blurs the boundaries between 'art' and 'literature'

- There's a technical 'gatekeeper'

- As Electronic Literature is so broad it's difficult to define

- Utilises 2nd person more frequently than print 

- Sometimes there's a frustrating feeling that the work can be limitless or infinite

- Can have audio/visual/text aspects

- Non-linear, multiple reads

- There's an expectation that you 'learn' to read the work


### Taroko Gorge(s) Remixes

[Tournedo Gorge] (https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/tournedo_gorge/)

#### What aspects of the remix are the same? 

- The text still unfurls at the same pace

- The ext still mimicks a 'gorge' or 'river' movement

- The text is still left indented and uses a similar font

- the text still have a full stop on the end of each line 

- stanza breaks remain similar

#### What aspects of the remix are different

- The source text has been changed

- The text moves closer to the bottom of the page, and appears as a continuous stream

- An image is included in the top right corner

- The poem is still in bright colours, but is now pink and black


#### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?  

The remix successful transitions from mimicking the natural movement of the river, which in turn reflects the clycical, and somewhat frustrating, drudgery of domesticity. The landguage too evokes this domesticity with a certain level of introduced playfulness in lines such as 'recipes want to'. Too, the work makes subtle references to its origins through expressions like 'pasture', linking the domestic to the outside. There may be some unintended errors in the code e.g. 'Javascript' and 'Operator'â€”untintended meanings may detract from the poem. The text can be quite difficult to read at times. 

## Week 4

### We Walk to You Remix

[I love cake always](https://meowing-fluoridated-count.glitch.me)

#### Reflection on the making poem

The poem I've created almost ceases to be a poem, in part due to the speed it's displayed. I went for a hideous aesthetic, which makes it feel more like tech art, or a hybrid. I feel this gave me a good basis for understanding and adpating code, and the design elements are becoming clearer to me. I do not feel, however, this form will influence my final work.
