### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do? (ie. fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)

I write across forms. At the moment I preominantly write long form nonfiction prose poetry (verse memoir), poetry, OP non-fiction, and literary fiction. 

#### What tools (or tecniques) do you use to write?

I use word, a mac, notes, voice memos, diaries/notebooks, google docs/squarespace and grammarly, photos/videos. storyboard. For longform work, and particularly when structuring, I use scrivner. I use pdf reader when editing visual work with inset text. I tend to create multiple files with an initial and number system, and refer to multiple documents at once; this means that there are usually several word documents open at once. I occassionally email notes to myself and sometimes texts. 

I tend to set timers, hour by hour, and give myself short breaks between; if i'm struggling to engage, I tend to write in shorter bursts with longer (5min) breaks. I write more efficiently in the morning before consuming any media so I often try and wake up earlish and start writing before I look at my phone or before talking to anyone. I tend to write sitting on my bed.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Implementing time parameters helps me mitigate issues with focus related to ADHD. Having multiple versions of documents open at once helps me to arrange ideas, implementing multiple structural elements as I go. Scrivner is helpful in arranging or fixing big picture issues.
