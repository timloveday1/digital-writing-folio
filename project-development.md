# Initial thoughts/ideas

While my research presentation was centred on Cecil Richards, who predominantly produces work using Bitsy, I feel like I want to develop a major project that helps me to practice my coding skills. Richards' work, perhaps then, inspires me in terms of its dealings with a fraught sense of nostalgia for a childhood and innocence lost in a time of rapidly shifting socio-cultural and political worldviews. 

Aesthically, I feel inspired by [Tarako Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/). Reflecting on the poem, I was reminded of natural and unatural systems, including railway lines, a perninent motif in much of my work. While aesthically adopting ideas from Tarako Gorge, I'm keen to make my work narrative based, like Richards' and non-generative. Instead, I think I'll centre mine on a auto-biographical poem which looks at a morning on the railway with my father. This will let me tackle the links between/trouble some big picture issues: 

- colonialisation and the minerals industry
- domestic violence, sexism and lock-room culture
- the habituation of masculinity in a rural context
- and the links between land violence and patriarchy

I already have a few works in mind that with some modification might be ideal for this project, but only time will tell. I like the idea of creating something with a larger thematic thread, which is driven tonally either through visuals, audio or some minor interactive elements. I'm keen to incorporate a voice over as I'm interested in investing in spoken-word spaces. I also like the idea of incorporating music/sound effects and some photography.

# Critical feedback from workshopping

Ben raised some concerns about the scope of my project. Questions include: 
- are there too many moving parts? 
- is the work, in all, too technically complex to complete within the deadline?
- Am I biting off more than I can chew? 
- is the work aesthetically overwhelming for the reader? ie. with fading images as well as synced audio and text, will the reader be able to follow the movement of the piece? 
- how difficult will it be to sync text with audio with images? is this technically too adventurous? 

Ben also suggested adding an 'entry button' so that the poem doesn't begind automatically (potentially difficult coding-wise). He also said that he felt this project might work in gallery spaces——which is exciting, and something I hadn't totally considered.  

Charles asked where I planned to source materials, such as soundbites/effects/music and images, as well as some source coding. 
Other students wondered whether I'd have time to complete a project of this magnitude. 


## Response/reflection on feedback

Overall, the class seemed impressed with the complexity of my project, as well as its current stage of development. 
I believe, in terms of skill development and materials acquisition, I should be okay, but need to remain vigilant during project development, potentially scaling back if necessary. As Ben outlined, syncing text with audio will likely be time intensive, as I may have to do this line by line. He did, kindly, however, put me onto howler.js

In terms of whether the work will be 'too overwhelming' or 'distracting' (because of the multiple moving parts), only time will tell I suppose. As I develop 'mock-ups' I think it's important to keep this in mind, and to, again, scale back if necessary (will a place-holding image do? Is this more powerful?)

I'm excited by the prospect of developing the work with a future gallery space in mind. With all the incporated media elements, as well as the 'big-picture' aesthetic, I think it could really work, driving my inspiration for the project.  


## Offering feedback to pitches

I was particularly impressed with both Charles and Lauren's major projects. Outside of class, I spoke to them both directly. Below is an outline of my thoughts: 

### Charles

I find Charle's work subversive, politically-charged and visually sardonic, and could immediately see applications beyond digital journals or spaces where digital literature might be traditionally published. Certainly, I'm concerned about how it might be 'read' (potentially offensive or inflamatory) but feel the work could be modified for commercial and educational purposes, particularly in educating young men on gender discourse (as space I write in often). During worhsopping, I told Charles I felt this work was a balancing act—that he'd have to turn the sarcasm up a notch so that the work can't be used to encourage INCELS and the like (the opposite to the desire effect) 

### Lauren's feedback

Lauren's work is refreshingly inventive; what a brilliant idea to subvert our expextations by incororating poetry into spam-ads, by offering a little bit of beauty in an otherwise frustrating poop-up. All the while, Lauren's work challenges some big-picture issues: 'fat-shaming' and 'dieting culture'. I told Lauren that beyond social commentary, and beyond literary journals and online arts' space, I felt her work could be used by the likes of writing orgs eg. imagine a Melbourne Writer's Festival or The Wheeler Centre incorprating this 'spam' into their website, essentially laying easter-eggs for avid literary fans. My major concern, which I raised in class as well as afterwards, was that her work might legitimately be confused for spam; would the average person follow what appears to be a spam link? I suggested really 'hamming up' the the copywriting on the spam link, to make it abundantly clear that there is exciting literary work beyond it. 

#### Overall reflection

Many styalistic and conceptual ideas raised during pitches (as well as the earlier practictioner presentations) made me think more broadly about digital literature, and what can be done. This seems, in so many ways, a space that can challenge language itself——and how we might create meaning on a fundamental level. When works are interactive yet narrative-based, who is the artist/writer? What differentiates art from poetry, and can a work be both installation and literature? 

I was particularly impressed by the overall ingenuity of my classmates. They're all really commited to experimenting in this space. For those choosing more 'narrative routes' (many working with Twine), I'm slightly concerned about the scope of their projects——which I raised, along-side Ben, during class. It is nice, however, to see the coalescing of genres, forms, ideas. It also seems that amny students, I supposed unsurpringly, are keen to tackle big issues or big thematic play-fieldings, such as race, colonisation and gender discourse. 

## Feedback on final project development

### Ruby's Feedback (dated 24/5/2022)

'Hi Tim, 

Thank you for sending me through your wonderful poem (and for giving me feedback on my poem)!

I think it’s a powerful, atmospheric and well-executed piece. So many lines stuck out to me, e.g. ’hands line obliterators’, ‘ironclad centipede’, ‘idiocy of dreams’, ‘their shapes glorious stitch lines in the fabric of all else’, ‘mother, secret keeper’, ‘the glue factory is coming’ (!) — and also more subtle elements, like the double (aural) implication of ‘men of lore’ (law) that a reader likely wouldn’t pick up on if the poem wasn’t being read aloud. The alignment of the audio elements (reading + music + sound effects) works well on both a technical and a poetic level. I also enjoyed the way that the thematic through-line (ha!) of the text carried effortlessly into the website’s imagery and audio. 

When you first showed me a short excerpt I was worried that the backing track might overpower your voice and the content of the poem, but after listening to it in full I think it enhances the aesthetic and message of the work — it really adds to the dark, cinematic tone. I can definitely see this piece being projected on a bigger scale, e.g. in a gallery space. 

My only concern was whether the entry button could have more design to it, to match the rest of the website — it looks a bit plain. Other than that, I think this piece is ready for the world! 

Best, 
Ruby'
