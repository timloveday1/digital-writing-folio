### Ruby's Feedback (dated 24/5/2022)

'Hi Tim, 

Thank you for sending me through your wonderful poem (and for giving me feedback on my poem)!

I think it’s a powerful, atmospheric and well-executed piece. So many lines stuck out to me, e.g. ’hands line obliterators’, ‘ironclad centipede’, ‘idiocy of dreams’, ‘their shapes glorious stitch lines in the fabric of all else’, ‘mother, secret keeper’, ‘the glue factory is coming’ (!) — and also more subtle elements, like the double (aural) implication of ‘men of lore’ (law) that a reader likely wouldn’t pick up on if the poem wasn’t being read aloud. The alignment of the audio elements (reading + music + sound effects) works well on both a technical and a poetic level. I also enjoyed the way that the thematic through-line (ha!) of the text carried effortlessly into the website’s imagery and audio. 

When you first showed me a short excerpt I was worried that the backing track might overpower your voice and the content of the poem, but after listening to it in full I think it enhances the aesthetic and message of the work — it really adds to the dark, cinematic tone. I can definitely see this piece being projected on a bigger scale, e.g. in a gallery space. 

My only concern was whether the entry button could have more design to it, to match the rest of the website — it looks a bit plain. Other than that, I think this piece is ready for the world! 

Best, 
Ruby'
