### "Decolonise" E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden - Kathi Inman Berens

• 'Permaculture' as opposed to 'gardening' as applied to 'E-lit theory'— Permaculture is largely self-sustaining
• Metaphor of 'Permaculture' used so that 'electronic literature community might “undertake a significant attempt to re-weave e-literature’s histories and genealogies, especially those pertaining to well-trodden paths of the avant-garde as framed within still dominant geographical and cultural perspectives.” 

• Anna Nacher speculates that E-lit could be made more resilient through 'decolonisation' - shift to diverse, non-eurocentric perspectives/voices/writing

• Argues movement to mainstream forces adherence to dominant instituitions and systems of thinking – may undermine diversity/perspective/generative aspects

• 'Scholarly fields make sharp distinctions about what is and isn’t within field parameters; doing so is one way to measure how a field evolves. The question “what is e-lit” is at the heart of field scholarship because one field expectation is that a consistent definition should regularize scientific outputs across cultures'

Florian Cramer in “Post-Digital Writing" suggests ELO's definition of E-lit is restrictive because it favours
1) works where author attribution is discernable
2) fiction (and poetry) stand in for literature as a whole 
3) peer review validates publication stand for literature as a whole
Leonardo Flores argues conception/intention is no prerequisite for E-lit; can be E-lit without authorship

•	E-lit, which started as an avante garde coterie has become a scholarly field

• Theory cannot ignore avante garde origins and origins in print

• Argues 'fellowships' etc. don't address structure inequality or issues pertaining to intituional bias, but ‘Symbolic work is followed up with structural change’

### Electronic Literature: What is it? - N. Katherine Hayles

• 'Electronic literature, generally considered to exclude print literature that has been digitized, is by contrast "digital born," a first-generation digital object created on a computer and (usually) meant to be read on a computer'

• Electronic Literature Organisation defines digital literature as 'work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer. This definition raises questions about capabilities and contexts. 

• Readers traditionally approach digital literature with expectations formed from print literary modes

• E-lit rapidly expanding, responding to tech advancements, cultural contexts, 'powerhouses of contemporary culture' eg. film, video games etc. 

• Digital literature hugely diverse and demarcations between forms, including print and digital, are often blurry or complex. Ditigal captures all print forms and more. 

• I'd appreciate a more definitive definition of 'Z-axis' (further research)

• Interactive narratives present problems in terms of mantaining Aristotelian narrative structure as reader becomes agent: "Giving the audience access to the raw materials of creation runs the risk of undermining the narrative experience'

• E-lit modes include Hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, locative narratives, installation pieces, "codework," generative art and the Flash poem – but are by no means an exhaustive inventory 

### Chapter 1. The Origins of Electronic Literature: An Overview - Giovanna di Rosario, Nohelia Meza and Kerri Grimaldi

• Argue E-lit saw origin at advent of computers with various definitions as a 'new area of study'

• Scott Rettberg’s definition, “electronic literature is most simply described as new forms and genres of writing that explore the specific capabilities of the computer and network – literature that would not be possible without the contemporary digital context”

• “Stochastic Texts” (1959) by Theo Lutz — considered first Digital text. However, contradicted by 1952 work of Christopher S. Strachey, a pioneer in computing 

• 'Lutz was just the first of a group of scholars to view mathematics, science, and creativity as cooperative disciplines'

• During 1980s poets increasingly engaged the digital, presenting work on screen etc.  

• Advent all over the world under different cultural contexts and modalities

• 'Animated poems long pre-dated a style of electronic poetic practice that erupted with the advent of the World Wide Web, typified by works such as Brian Kim Stefans’ The Dreamlife of Letters (2000).'

• Some countries developed interests and movements in electronic poetry simultaneously — similar cultural contexts and backgrounds

• 'It seems to us that digital literature is globally and constantly growing, and it has been transforming itself thanks to or because of the advent of other new interfaces, supports, and media.'


## Week 2

### Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade - Jeremy Douglass

- "Interactive fiction is a story in which YOU are the main character."

- Interactive Fiction overhwleming written in 2nd person, utilising directives/emphatic statements (90% of games). T

-  2nd person was popularised/marketed by Infocom despite being from IF's first days, and through its period as Tolkien art. 
 
- Shade is playfully self-referential, and referential to art practice, situated the action in the boundaries of the 'office-space' or 'apartment'. 'Apartment pieces' usually refer to work from authors new to a medium who begin with a 'detailed' model of everything around them' 

- 'Shade' subverts 'apartment pieces' which often lack action and conflict by weaving a non-linear and dual narrative. In this way it rejects and reimagines tropes and is an observation on the boundlessness of our imagination and the boundless lands of digital creation

- An essential aspect of IF (Interactive Fiction) is light and its manipulation

- ‘Like game books and RPGs, IF was arguably predated by simulation methods that emphasized fact over fantasy and system over story’!

- IF works beyond simulation, occuring as if from the player's viewerpoint, addressing the player directly in the simulation ('you'). 'Second-person narration ("You are") evokes first-person participation ("I am!").' Second person text is the most immediate, as the 'you' (or 'I') is removed.


## Week 3

### Beyond Txonomy: Digital poetics and the problem of reading - Talon Memmot

• ‘The actualities of poetic practice in the digital environment are too diverse to permit a comprehensive or coherent taxonomy.’ (pg. 293)

• Some digital narratives and digital poetry has not author or authorial text

• 'Because digital poetry cannot be reduced to a genre of poetry we must begin to consider the applied poetics of the individual practitioner.’ (294)

• ‘The user is engaged on the level of consumption rather than participation' (296) - not all digital work requires interaction, decision making etc.

• ‘The ability to cause thinking is an essential part of digital poetics and rhetoric, and it is here that literacy hypermedia finds its greatest potential. (pg. 303)


### Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier - Lori Emerson

• ‘we cannot crave what is ubiquitous’ (pg. 1)

• how user-interfaces are becoming invisible in their commonplace use in 'third-wave computing' — turning us into consumers rather than producers

•‘unless we pause from time to time to consider how these metaphors work to create boundaries… they will control us without our knowledge (pg. 3, Robert Swigart) – ‘interface now obscures software’ 

• We have limited tools now – rather we have 'choices' (pg. 3) meaning things will just 'happen'.

• User interface art has become marginilised as interfaces become invisible (pg. 4)

• 'Natural' or 'minimalist' apart of a movement of invisibility, yet these are 'intermixed' in cultural expectations/norms (pg. 5 and 8)

• 'The future of computing is domineering, branded and boring' (pg. 9)
