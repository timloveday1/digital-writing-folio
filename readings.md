### "Decolonise" E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden - Kathi Inman Berens

• 'Permaculture' as opposed to 'gardening' as applied to 'E-lit theory'— Permaculture is largely self-sustaining
• Metaphor of 'Permaculture' used so that 'electronic literature community might “undertake a significant attempt to re-weave e-literature’s histories and genealogies, especially those pertaining to well-trodden paths of the avant-garde as framed within still dominant geographical and cultural perspectives.” 

• Anna Nacher speculates that E-lit could be made more resilient through 'decolonisation' - shift to diverse, non-eurocentric perspectives/voices/writing

• Argues movement to mainstream forces adherence to dominant instituitions and systems of thinking – may undermine diversity/perspective/generative aspects

• 'Scholarly fields make sharp distinctions about what is and isn’t within field parameters; doing so is one way to measure how a field evolves. The question “what is e-lit” is at the heart of field scholarship because one field expectation is that a consistent definition should regularize scientific outputs across cultures'

Florian Cramer in “Post-Digital Writing" suggests ELO's definition of 'E-lit' is restrictive because it favours
1) works where author attribution is discernable
2) fiction (and poetry) stand in for literature as a whole 
3) peer review validates publication stand for literature as a whole
Leonardo Flores argues conception/intention is no prerequisite for 'E-lit'; can be 'E-lit' without authorship
•	E-lit, which started as an avante garde coterie has become a scholarly field
• Theory cannot ignore avante garde origins and origins in print
• Argues 'fellowships' etc. don't address structure inequality or issues pertaining to intituional bias, but ‘Symbolic work is followed up with structural change’
